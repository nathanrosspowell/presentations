# Intro

The information here should get everyone up to speed on the words that programmers use all the time.

These slides will be more like a giant cheat sheet than a structured lesson.

It's good to have a general idea of what these words and concepts mean, but don't stress about remembering all of it.

# Easy Topics

The set of upcoming words are relatively easy to explain in a few short sentences.
If you have never heard of them before do _not_ worry!

You are not going to become an expert in one hour but you will have some kind of basic understanding (hopefully)!

# Memory

This is RAM (Random Access Memory).
Your computer probably has a lot of it!

A computers memory is where currently executing programs live.
Whereas the hard drive is where _all_ computer programs (`.exe` files) live.

# Variable/Variables

The basic building block of any computer program.
It is a named container of 'something'.

Here we have named 'integers' AKA, whole numbers.
```cpp
int variable = 1;
int VARIABLE = 1 + 1;
int _var = 3;
int MY_VAR = 4;
int myVariableName = 5;
int and_so_on = 5 + 1;
int timeOfDay = 7;
```
A variable is the name for a piece of data, which is understandable to humans!
Giving variables a good name is a daily struggle for programmers.

.right-column[
# Functions
While variables are data, functions are groups of command.
A function is a programming convention of grouping together and naming a set of commands, which you can then use multiple times.
 Here is a trivial function, that does something which you dont want to type multiple times.

```cpp
int Money()
{
    int moneyInBank = 1000;
    int moneyInWallet = 50;
    int moneyInPockets = 5;
    return moneyInBank + moneyInWallet + moneyInPockets;
}
```
The 'Money' function can be used as many times as you like. In programmer talk we say that you 'call the function'.

```cpp
int myMoney = Money(); // Calling 'Money'
```

.right-column[
# Pointers

You can think of an pointer as an alias.

Just as James Bond has the alias of "007", a variable can have an alias.

In a spreadsheet you can make a cell get it's value from another cell.
You make the first cell 'point' to a second one.

```cpp
int* megaTimeOfDay = &timeOfDay; // An int pointer
```
When you use `megaTimeOfDay` like an `int` it will  give you the current value of `timeOfDay`, even if someone changes that value.

_(The '*' means pointer, the '&' means 'get the memory address for' the variable. Don't worry about it.)_

# Structures

`struct => structure`

A structure is a collection of variables which define something bigger.

```cpp
struct Time
{
    int hours;
    int minutes;
    int seconds;
};
```
You can then make a variable which is an 'instance' of your structure.

```cpp
Time timeOfDay;
```

_(That form of code is allowed, but it is not great. You will learn why later)_

# Class

A class is the same a 'struct' but with more rules.

A class restricts access to the variables it contains.

```cpp
class Time
{
*public:
    int hours;
*protected;
    int minutes;
*private:
    int seconds;
};
```
`public` variables can be accessed anywhere. `protected` and `private` are more restrive.

# Binary

Binary is the classic computer 'language' of 1's and 0's!

```cpp
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
0100 = 4
0101 = 5
0001 + 0100 = 0101
```

This is called 'base 2'.
Instead of counting to 10 before using another digit to represent the number, you only count to 2.

You will rarely use binary numbers directly in code.

Imagine a world where people have 16 fingers, this is how they 'count'

    0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F

    | Bits | Decimal             | Hexidecimal         |
    |======|=====================|=====================|
    | 0001 | 1 * 1 = 1           | 1 * 1 = 1           |
    | 0010 | 1* 10 = 10          | 1 * 16 = 16         |
    | 0100 | 10* 10 = 100        | 16 * 16 = 256       |
    | 1000 | 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 | 16 * 16 * 16 = 4096 |

# Call Stack

The 'stack' of 'calls'...

A stack is a first on, last off concept.

	1   1st push
	12  2nd push
	123 3rd push
	12  1st pop
	124 4th push
	12  2nd pop
	1   3rd pop
	    4th pop

A function gets added to the stack when you use it (call it).
It gets removed when the function ends.

In the example stack, function 2 calls 3 and 4 before it ends.

# The Stack

The variabls that a function creates all live on their 'The Stack'.
While our Call Stack is a stack of functions, The Stack is a stack of memory addresses.

As a function executes, each variable gets added to the stack.
When the function finishes, they all get 'popped' off as they're not needed.
This happens in the order you expect - first on, last off.

Memory leaks do not come from variables on the stack.
But, you will have trouble if you return pointers to things on the stack!

]
.right-column[
# The Heap

The Heap is a place where variables live also, but it doesn't work the same way.

If you make a variable on The Heap, it will stay there until you decided to remove it.
The way to do this is `C++` is with the `new` and `delete` keywords.

The Heap is where memory leaks happen.
Make a new variable on The Heap and you will get a pointer to it.
If you loose that pointer (it goes out of scope, you set the pointer to be another value, etc) then there is NO WAY to remove the variable.

In C# the 'new' keyword is very different.
You don't have to worry about memory leaks in C#.

# Base 2 and Base 16

Another name for Binary and Hexidecimal.
The 

    Base  2 -> 0010 =  2  - 0, 1
    Base 10 -> 0010 = 10  - 0, 1, ... 8, 9
    Base 16 -> 0010 = 16  - 0, 1, ... E, F
    Base 99 -> 0010 = 99  - 0, 1, ... '98', '99'
    
Here you can see that any base can be used.
It is very inconvinent that we can't express '10' in one numerical digit, that is why Hexidecimal uses 'A'.

_(I don't know of any use for Base 99)_
