# Intro

First, we will go over how to use the debugger more effectivly.

You will have used the debugger for the practical work in this series.
This code, while challenging, has been kept as minimal as possible.
When making your own programs you will add _A LOT_ of code.
It is important to be able to use the debugger to correctly identify the mistakes you have made.

Secondly, we will outline potential personal projects.

To make your own program you need to set your own goals and requirements.
These will be different for each person and it will lead to everyone having their own solutions.
Hopefully everything you've learned (and been refreshed on) will come in useful!
